# Voice2Docs Public

Voice2Docs - a VSCode plugin to use spoken natural language (literally) to create developer documentation.

## Overview

Tired of writing developer docs? Do you forget how to add links to markdown files? Spending too much time trying to format the docs to sound like a developer? Same.

That's why I created Voice2Docs.
